The application starts by importing the Tkinter library and the messagebox module. The is_valid function checks whether a given number can be placed in a specific cell of the Sudoku board. It does so by iterating over the row and column to ensure the number doesnâ€™t already exist there. Additionally, it checks the corresponding 3x3 sub-box for the same number. This validation is crucial for maintaining the Sudoku rules.

Next, the solve_sudoku function employs a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It scans the board for empty cells (represented by '.') and tries placing numbers from '1' to '9'. For each number, it invokes the is_valid function to confirm its placement. If the number fits, the function calls itself recursively to continue solving. If placing a number leads to a dead end, the function undoes the last placement (backtracking) and tries the next number until a solution is found or confirmed that no solution exists.

The fill_board function initializes a predefined Sudoku board and attempts to solve it using the solve_sudoku function. If a solution is found, it populates the input fields in the GUI with the solution; otherwise, it triggers an error message using the messagebox.showerror function to inform the user that no solution exists.

The GUI is created in the create_gui function, which sets up the main window of the application. The window is titled "Sudoku Solver" and has a specified geometry. A canvas with a pastel pink background (#FADADD) serves as the main area of the application. The canvas also features pastel-colored digits randomly arranged at 45-degree angles to enhance the aesthetic appeal. The digits are displayed in various pastel shades using a list of color codes, which are cycled through as they are drawn.

An entry label, "Sudoku Solver," is placed at the top of the window in a bold font, providing clarity and focus. Below the heading, a frame is created to hold the Sudoku grid entries, which are styled with a pink background and customized entry fields. Each entry box is defined to have a specific width, font, and color properties to match the overall theme. The entries are arranged in a 9x9 grid using the grid layout manager, with padding for better spacing.

Finally, a "Solve" button is added below the grid. This button, when clicked, triggers the fill_board function to attempt solving the puzzle. It is styled with a pink background and white text, providing a visually appealing and cohesive look. The button's appearance changes on interaction, enhancing user experience.

Overall, the Sudoku solver application combines functional programming for logic and elegant design elements using Tkinter, creating a user-friendly interface that adheres to the pastel pink theme while effectively solving Sudoku puzzles.
