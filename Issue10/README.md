## What is Next.js?

**Next.js** is an open-source React framework that enables developers to build server-rendered applications and static websites using React. Some key features of Next.js include:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Automatically pre-renders pages on the server for better performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time, delivering them as static files for optimal speed.
- **API Routes**: Allows developers to create API endpoints within the application, simplifying data handling.
- **File-Based Routing**: Simplifies navigation with a built-in routing system based on the file structure.
- **Built-in CSS and Sass support**: Facilitates styling of components directly within the application.

Next.js is ideal for building fast, user-friendly web applications, making it a perfect choice for our event scheduling and community engagement application.

## What is Supabase?

**Supabase** is an open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a powerful backend as a service (BaaS). It offers a range of features that simplify the development of applications, including:

- **Database Management**: Supabase uses PostgreSQL, enabling developers to work with a robust relational database.
- **Real-time Capabilities**: It allows for real-time updates, making it suitable for applications that require instant data synchronization, such as chat applications.
- **User Authentication**: Supabase provides easy-to-use authentication methods, including email/password login and social media OAuth.
- **Storage**: Supabase offers file storage capabilities, enabling developers to manage user uploads efficiently.
- **APIs**: Automatically generates RESTful APIs based on the database schema, making it easy to interact with data.

### Real-time Chat Application

Using Supabase, we can implement a real-time chat system within our application, allowing users to communicate effectively. Key features of the chat system include:

- **Real-time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages instantly, enhancing the communication experience.
- **Online/Offline Status**: The system can display whether users are online or offline, providing visibility into user availability.
- **Chat History**: Messages can be stored in the database, allowing users to access previous conversations.
- **Moderation Tools**: Admins can manage chat content, ensuring a safe and friendly environment for users.


## User Authentication

The application features a secure login system that supports two types of users:

1. **Normal Users**: 
   - Have limited control within the application.
   - Can register for events, submit reviews, and participate in community discussions.
   - Can view and engage with content but cannot create or manage events.

2. **Admin Users**: 
   - Have full control over the application.
   - Can create, edit, and delete events.
   - Can moderate user-generated content, including reviews and community posts.
   - Have access to the event dashboard for managing registrations and event details.
