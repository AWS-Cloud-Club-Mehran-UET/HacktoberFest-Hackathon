The Expense Tracker is a simple web application designed to help users manage their finances effectively. This application allows users to keep track of their income and expenses seamlessly. It includes user authentication features, enabling users to sign up, log in, and manage their financial data securely.

In the application, users can add their income by providing details such as the amount, source, and date. Once added, income transactions are displayed in a list format, allowing users to view their financial inflow easily. Additionally, users can log their expenses, including details like the amount spent, category (such as food, travel, or entertainment), description, and date of the transaction. The expense list is dynamically updated, and users have the ability to edit or delete entries as needed.

A notable feature of the Expense Tracker is its search functionality, which allows users to filter through their expenses using keywords and specific date ranges. This makes it easier to find specific transactions amidst potentially large amounts of data.

The application is built using standard web technologies, including HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content management. The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a user-friendly experience across various devices.

To get started with the Expense Tracker, users simply need to clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser. They can then create an account by signing up with an email and password. After logging in, users can begin adding income and expenses, editing or deleting transactions, and utilizing the search feature to manage their financial activities efficiently.

The project is structured with an index.html file that serves as the main entry point, a styles.css file for visual styling, and a script.js file that contains all the necessary JavaScript code for functionality.
