# Sudoku Solver Algorithm Explanation

## Introduction

This algorithm solves a given partially filled Sudoku grid using **backtracking**, a recursive algorithmic approach. The goal is to assign values to all unassigned locations in such a way that no number is repeated in any row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Base Case**:  
   If the algorithm reaches the last row (`row = 8`) and the last column (`col = 9`), the grid is complete and a solution has been found, so the function returns `true`.

2. **Move to the Next Row**:  
   If the current column (`col`) becomes 9, this means the algorithm has reached the end of the current row. It moves to the next row and resets the column to 0.

3. **Skip Filled Cells**:  
   If the current cell already has a number (i.e., `grid[row][col] != 0`), the algorithm moves to the next cell by incrementing the column index.

4. **Try Possible Numbers**:  
   For an empty cell (`grid[row][col] == 0`), the algorithm tries placing numbers from 1 to 9. For each number, it checks if the number can be legally placed at that position using the `isSafe()` function.

5. **Check Constraints (isSafe Function)**:
    - **Row Constraint**: The number must not already exist in the current row.
    - **Column Constraint**: The number must not exist in the current column.
    - **Sub-grid Constraint**: The number must not exist in the 3x3 sub-grid that contains the cell.

6. **Backtrack if Necessary**:  
   If the number is valid, it is placed in the cell, and the algorithm recursively moves to the next column. If no valid number can be placed in a cell, the algorithm backtracks by resetting the cell to 0 and tries the next possible number in the previous cell.

7. **Solution Found or No Solution**:  
   If a valid configuration is found, the function returns `true`. If no valid configuration exists (i.e., no number can be placed in any unfilled cell), the function returns `false`, indicating that no solution exists for the given Sudoku grid.

## Key Points of the Algorithm
- **Backtracking**: The algorithm attempts to place numbers in the grid and backtracks whenever it encounters a number that violates the Sudoku rules.
- **Recursion**: The algorithm calls itself for every cell to explore possible number placements until the grid is filled or a solution is found.
- **Efficiency**: The `isSafe()` function helps avoid placing invalid numbers, significantly reducing the number of backtracking steps.

## Example Workflow
1. Start from the top-left corner of the grid.
2. For each cell, place a number if it doesn't violate Sudoku rules.
3. Move to the next cell and repeat the process.
4. If a valid number can't be placed in a cell, backtrack and try a different number in the previous cell.
5. Repeat the process until the entire grid is filled or no solution is possible.

## Conclusion
This backtracking-based approach effectively solves Sudoku puzzles by exploring all potential solutions and backtracking when invalid placements are encountered. While the approach works for standard 9x9 Sudoku grids, it can be applied to larger grids with proper adjustments to the constraints and grid size.
