Explanation of Each Function:

1. solveSudoku():

This is the main function that takes the board (the Sudoku puzzle represented as a 9x9 grid of characters) as input.

It calls the helper function solve() to recursively solve the puzzle.

Once the puzzle is solved, the board is updated with the solution.



2. solve():

This is a recursive function that fills in the empty cells of the Sudoku puzzle.

It iterates through each row and column of the board to find empty cells (represented by '.').

For each empty cell, it tries placing the digits '1' to '9' and checks if the placement is valid using the isValid() function.

If the digit is valid, it temporarily places it on the board and recursively calls solve() to continue solving the rest of the board.

If a solution is found, the function returns true. Otherwise, it backtracks by resetting the cell to '.' and continues trying other digits.

If no solution is found for a particular configuration, the function returns false, which signals that it needs to backtrack.



3. isValid():

This function checks whether placing a particular digit c at position (row, col) on the board is valid according to the rules of Sudoku.

It performs three checks:

1. The digit should not already appear in the current row.


2. The digit should not already appear in the current column.


3. The digit should not already appear in the current 3x3 sub-box that contains the cell (row, col).



If all three conditions are satisfied, the function returns true, indicating that placing the digit c is valid.

If any condition is violated, it returns false.
