## üìù How to Participate

### Step 1: Registration and Access
1. Once registered, we will provide access to this repository. You will have write access, so ensure you use it responsibly.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AWS-Cloud-Club-Mehran-UET/HacktoberFest-Hackathon

## Step 2: Explore Issues

   1. Navigate to the Issues tab.
   2. You can view all open issues, which represent problems to be solved during the hackathon.

## Step 3: Assign Issues to Yourself

   1. You are allowed to assign up to 3 issues to yourself.
   2. To assign an issue, go to the issue page, click the "Assignees" button on the right, and assign yourself the issue.
   3. You will have 4 to 5 hours (depending on the event schedule) to work on the assigned issues.

## Step 4: Create a New Branch

    git checkout -b team-name-<issue-number>


## Step 5: Solve the Issues
  Work on solving the issues you have selected. Make sure to follow any guidelines or instructions given in the issue description.
    Commit your changes frequently using meaningful commit messages:


    git add .
    git commit -m "Fix issue #42: Improved UI performance"

## Step 6: Describe Your Approach
After solving the issue, you must describe your approach to solving the issue in your branch's README.md file. This is a mandatory step to ensure clarity and understanding of your solution.

   Include details such as the logic you used, the challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.

## Step 7: Push Your Code
  Once you are done solving the issue, push your branch to the repository:


      git push origin team-name-<issue-number>
      
  for example 
      
      git push origin issue-42

## Step 8: Create a Pull Request (PR)

   After pushing your code, create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch. Ensure your PR description includes references to the issue number using:


    Resolves #<issue-number>

   You must create the pull request before the time limit ends. If you fail to do so, your work will be considered null and void.

## Step 9: Review and Feedback

   Once the PR is created, our team will review the code. Make sure your solution is complete and well-documented.
    If any changes are requested, make sure to update your PR within the given time frame.

## Avoid the Use of AI Tools
 Participants must avoid using AI tools (e.g., AI code generators, AI assistants) to solve issues. We value original problem-solving approaches and creativity. Any evidence of using AI to generate code will result in disqualification.
 
## ‚è≥ Time Limits

   Each participant has 4-5 hours to solve their assigned issues.
    You must create a pull request before the time ends; otherwise, your submission will not be considered.

## üö´ Disqualification Rules

 Failure to submit a PR before the time ends will result in the solution being considered null and void.
    Any form of plagiarism or unauthorized use of third-party code without proper attribution will lead to disqualification.
